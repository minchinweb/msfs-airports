	<ReleaseNote Version="0.1.2" Date="2025-11-22">This is the initial implementation/recreation!

Cooking Lake has been a seaplane base for over a century, but flights are very few now as the lake has become very shallow. But that doesn't need to stop us in MSFS!

Includes two water runways (10-28 to match CEZ3, and east-west (07-25)), but really, you can take off in whatever direction suites your fancy.
Also includes a couple of docks to park at.</ReleaseNote>
